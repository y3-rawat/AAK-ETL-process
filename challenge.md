## Why API insted of Selenium/BeatifulSoup/Scrapy/etc.

I chose to use API fetching instead of traditional web scraping tools for several compelling reasons:

1. Data Reliability: The World Bank API provides official, curated data directly from the source. This ensures higher accuracy and consistency compared to scraping potentially inconsistent web pages.

2. Efficiency: API calls are generally faster and more resource-efficient than web scraping. They allow us to retrieve precisely the data we need without downloading and parsing entire web pages.

3. Structured Data: The API returns data in a structured JSON format, which is easier to parse and process compared to HTML from web pages. This simplifies our ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline and reduces the risk of errors.

4. Scalability: APIs are designed to handle multiple requests efficiently, making our solution more scalable for large-scale data retrieval and processing(Enabled Parallel Processing).

5. Stability: Unlike web scraping, which can break when website layouts change, APIs provide a stable interface that is less likely to change unexpectedly.

6. Legal and Ethical Considerations: Using an official API respects the World Bank's terms of service and eliminates potential legal issues associated with web scraping.

7. Real-time Updates: APIs often provide the most up-to-date information, ensuring our data is current and relevant.

8. Error Handling: APIs typically provide clear error messages and status codes, making it easier to handle and debug issues in our data pipeline.

By leveraging the World Bank API, we've created a more robust, efficient, and maintainable solution for fetching and processing country data.

## Why JSON Files Instead of SQL or MongoDB

For this project, I opted to use JSON files for data storage instead of a traditional SQL database or a NoSQL solution like MongoDB. This decision was based on several factors that align well with the project's requirements and constraints:

1. Simplicity and Portability: JSON files are simple to work with and highly portable. They can be easily transferred, backed up, and version-controlled without the need for a database server.

2. Native Format Compatibility: The World Bank API returns data in JSON format. By storing this data directly in JSON files, we maintain the native structure of the data without the need for complex transformations or schema definitions.

3. Lightweight Solution: For projects that don't require complex querying or don't deal with massive amounts of concurrent writes, JSON files provide a lightweight alternative to full-fledged databases, reducing system overhead and complexity.

4. Easy Integration with Python: Python has excellent built-in support for JSON, making it straightforward to read, write, and manipulate the data without additional database drivers or ORMs.

5. Flexibility for Changing Data Structures: As the World Bank API might evolve or we might need to store additional metadata, JSON's flexible structure allows us to easily adapt our data storage without schema migrations.

6. Reduced Setup and Maintenance: Using JSON files eliminates the need for database setup, configuration, and ongoing maintenance, simplifying the deployment and operation of the application.

7. Suitable for Read-Heavy Workloads: If the application primarily reads data and updates are infrequent, JSON files can provide good performance without the complexity of a database system.

8. Easy Data Inspection: JSON files can be easily opened and inspected using any text editor, making debugging and data verification straightforward.

9. Compatibility with Serverless Architectures: JSON files can be easily stored in and served from cloud storage solutions, making the application well-suited for serverless architectures if needed in the future.

10. Sufficient for Current Scale: For the current scale of the World Bank data and the project requirements, JSON files provide a good balance of simplicity, performance, and functionality.

While this approach has its limitations, such as lack of advanced querying capabilities and potential scalability issues for very large datasets or high concurrent write scenarios, it serves our current needs efficiently. As the project grows, we can reassess and potentially migrate to a database solution if required, using our JSON files as a solid foundation for data migration.



## Minimal Data Transformation Approach

In this project, I deliberately chose to perform minimal transformations on the JSON data received from the World Bank API. This decision was made with several important considerations in mind:

1. Long-term Usability: The code is designed for long-term use rather than a one-time data extraction. By keeping the data close to its original format, we maintain flexibility for future use cases and evolving requirements.

2. Cross-Country Compatibility: The World Bank data encompasses a wide range of countries, each with potentially unique indicators or data structures. Minimal transformation ensures our solution remains adaptable to these variations without requiring constant adjustments.

3. Preservation of Original Semantics: Many fields in the World Bank data use specific terminology or categorizations that carry nuanced meanings. By avoiding extensive transformations, we preserve these nuances, which might be crucial for accurate analysis and interpretation.

4. Reduced Risk of Data Loss: Aggressive transformation can sometimes lead to unintended data loss or misinterpretation. Our approach minimizes this risk by keeping the data as close to the source format as possible.

5. Easier Traceability: With minimal transformations, it's easier to trace data back to its original source, which is crucial for verification and auditing purposes.

6. Flexibility for Future Analysis: By retaining the original structure, we allow future users of the data to apply their own transformations as needed, rather than imposing a fixed structure that might not suit all use cases.

7. Adaptability to API Changes: The World Bank API may evolve over time. Minimal transformation makes our code more resilient to these changes, requiring fewer updates to accommodate new or modified data structures.

8. Efficient Processing: By reducing the amount of upfront transformation, we optimize the initial data retrieval and storage process, which is particularly beneficial when dealing with large datasets from multiple countries.

This approach does mean that users of the data may need to perform some transformations at the analysis stage. However, it provides maximum flexibility and ensures that the core data remains as faithful to the original source as possible. This strategy aligns well with the project's goal of creating a robust, adaptable solution for long-term use across diverse country datasets.
