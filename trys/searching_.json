Interviews at unofficial crossing points were held with key informants such as local residents in border areas, drivers, hotel and restaurant owners or border officials in over 50 locations, through Kunduz, Jalalabad, Herat, Gardez, Mazar and Kandahar field locations. Key informants gave estimates of weekly flows and their composition. This monitoring activity found that the majority of movements to Iran (84%) happen via unofficial border crossings, while less than 1% of movements to Pakistan happen via unofficial border crossings.<br><br>This dataset is the anonymized version of the original data.",

As part of this process, UNHCR interviews refugees willing to return to Afghanistan at the Voluntary Repatriation Centers in the country of asylum, monitors the return condition through household-level interviews at the Encashment Centers in Afghanistan and follows up on the returnees' situation in the areas of return one to six months later through phone surveys. Upon return to Afghanistan, returnees are assisted at four Encashment Centers with a cash grant to support their immediate humanitarian needs and transportation costs.<br><br>This dataset is from household interviews at the Encashment Centers. Other datasets from Encashment Centers are available for each year from 2010 to 2022. The objective of the interviews is to record details on the returnee households and family members including the amount of cash grant received.",

The numbers are overwhelming: 97% of Afghans could potentially plunge into poverty by mid-2022 and half the country’s population is in need of humanitarian assistance. Following the record displacement of nearly 700,000 people in 2021, some 9.2 million IDPs and returnees remain in some form of displacement and in need of support to return where possible. These staggeringly high levels of displacement are fueling a range of protection risks, particularly for undocumented Afghans returning to the country, including those deported from neighbouring countries. <br><br>Massive economic contraction along with crisis in banking and financial system, severe drought and rising food prices, has meant people have resorted increasingly to negative coping strategies. Despite the significant decrease in the overall level of conflict and number of civilian casualties following the changes in the political environment since 15 August 2021, threats to the civilian population in Afghanistan persist including the killing and injury of civilians, high levels of explosive ordnance contamination, forced displacement, gender-based violence and violations against children.<br><br>The report was prepared in collaboration with six partners undertaking protection monitoring: DRC, IOM, IRC, NRC, CORDAid and UNHCR, using the data collected in 2021 from 37,258 households.",
